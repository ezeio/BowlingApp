# BowlingApp
A command line bowling application developed using BDD and TDD 

For this exercise I’d like you to develop a console application in Java which keeps score for a 10-pin bowling game (rules and scoring can be found here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Rules_of_play)

 

I would like to be able to choose between 1 and 4 players (which each have a name and a score history for the last 3 games, lifetime average score and lifetime balls bowled, full requirement below and you can email me any questions you have)

 

Obviously don’t use Google as I will check your final code using an anti-plagiarism tool and a failure against that tool will prevent us going any further in this process.

 

Requirements

·         Menu to start new game or view player history

·         Select New Game - add 1 -4 players, add their names or choose from existing (previous) players and start a game

·         Game runs for 10 frames and scores according to rules of play above). Option to end game early.

·         Players need to enter their score after every ball

·         The scoreboard needs to be shown in the console.

·         When it is a players turn to bowl the screen needs to show their name followed by their average frame score and total balls bowled history.

·         Players accumulate total balls bowled, average frame score during a game

·         Players accumulate game score history (3 games min) at the end of each game

·         View Player history shows the player list and stats

·         All history is only kept whilst the console application is running so you don’t need to worry about storing data anywhere

·         TDD

 

If you can get the full source code back to me ASAP that would be great.

 

Thanks and regards,
